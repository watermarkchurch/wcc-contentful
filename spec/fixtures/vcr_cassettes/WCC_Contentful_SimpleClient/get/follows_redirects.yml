        applying for a new\u0026nbsp;job,\u0026nbsp;what\u0026#39;s the one thing
        that is almost\u0026nbsp;always\u0026nbsp;requested from\u0026nbsp;you?\u0026nbsp;That\u0026#39;s
        right,\u0026nbsp;your r\u0026eacute;sum\u0026eacute;!\u0026nbsp;For some,
        this\u0026nbsp;can be a boost of confidence in what they\u0026#39;ve\u0026nbsp;accomplished
        that might\u0026nbsp;comfort them\u0026nbsp;in how\u0026nbsp;qualified they
        are for the position. For others, this might\u0026nbsp;be\u0026nbsp;defeating
        as they look at their r\u0026eacute;sum\u0026eacute; feeling\u0026nbsp;they
        need to accomplish more and\u0026nbsp;just don\u0026#39;t measure up. Regardless
        of which end of the spectrum you land\u0026nbsp;on, this\u0026nbsp;list of
        qualifications can carry some weight in\u0026nbsp;how we view ourselves, as
        well as how we might believe we are seen.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThinking
        about my\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003espiritual\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003er\u0026eacute;sum\u0026eacute;,\u0026nbsp;I
        can be quick to view God as a CEO who is\u0026nbsp;pleased with me\u0026nbsp;based
        on\u0026nbsp;what I have or haven\u0026#39;t accomplished. Man\u0026#39;s
        works, however, have never been the means by which God is pleased, no matter
        how much or how little we have done.\u0026nbsp;As stated in verse 3,\u0026nbsp;all
        that Abraham did was \u003cem\u003ebelieve \u003c/em\u003eGod, and this alone
        is what allowed him to stand\u0026nbsp;right with God.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBecause
        of our sin, it\u0026#39;s impossible for us to be good enough by our own merit,
        but, luckily, God doesn\u0026#39;t expect us to. He doesn\u0026#39;t ask us
        to do all the right things, but just to first acknowledge our inability to
        meet the standard on our own, believe that Christ met it for us through his
        death\u0026nbsp;on the cross, and\u0026nbsp;trust fully in who He is rather
        than in ourselves. When I become prideful in relying on my own abilities,
        I am living\u0026nbsp;in the selfish belief that what I do matters more than
        what Christ has done. He is the only One who justifies the ungodly, and we
        have the choice to find freedom living dependently through\u0026nbsp;faith
        in Him rather than\u0026nbsp;in ourselves (verse 5). He doesn\u0026#39;t look
        at our \u003cem\u003espiritual\u003c/em\u003e r\u0026eacute;sum\u0026eacute;,
        but He instead\u0026nbsp;looks past our shortcomings and offers us forgiveness
        for our sin (verses 7-8). Let\u0026#39;s rejoice and find freedom in this
