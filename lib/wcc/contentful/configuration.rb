  # Defines the method by which content is downloaded from the Contentful CDN.

  # [:direct] `config.content_delivery = :direct`
  #           with the `:direct` method, all queries result in web requests to
  #           'https://cdn.contentful.com' via the
  #           {WCC::Contentful::SimpleClient::Cdn SimpleClient}
  #
  # [:eager_sync] `config.content_delivery = :eager_sync, [sync_store], [options]`
  #               with the `:eager_sync` method, the entire content of the Contentful
  #               space is downloaded locally and stored in the
  #               {WCC::Contentful::Services#store configured store}.  The application is
  #               responsible to periodically call `WCC::Contentful.sync!` to keep the store
  #               updated. Alternatively, the provided {WCC::Contentful::Engine Engine}
  #               can be mounted to receive a webhook from the Contentful space
  #               on publish events:
  #                 mount WCC::Contentful::Engine, at: '/wcc/contentful'
  #
  # [:lazy_sync] `config.content_delivery = :lazy_sync, [cache]`
  #              The `:lazy_sync` method is a hybrid between the other two methods.
  #              Frequently accessed data is stored in an ActiveSupport::Cache implementation
  #              and is kept up-to-date via the Sync API.  Any data that is not present
  #              in the cache is fetched from the CDN like in the `:direct` method.
  #              The application is still responsible to periodically call `sync!`
  #              or to mount the provided Engine.
